## Inspiration
I wanted to build something that helps people. Many people right now are very afraid of the ongoing Covid pandemic and might want to either get checked on that, and/or receive Mental support. My app does just that!

## What it does
Helperex provides a FREE Coronavirus Self-Checker from CDC and a Counseling ChatBot from HelloTars through a unique UI interface.

## How we built it
I designed the UI first, to make sure the user can easily have access through the whole website. Then, it was a lot of HTML and CSS to follow the proper UI design. A lot of embedding was involved as the main goal was to include the CDC and HelloTars services.

## Challenges we ran into
Embeddings!! It was very hard to embed the elements into the webpage as they were all from different sources and places.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I was able to learn a lot from this project. But most importantly, I wish this can help many people who are suffering during this pandemic.

## What we learned
A few things I learned:
1. UI designs
2. Embeddings
3. Bootstrap

But the experience of making all of it work is the best in all this!

## What's next for Helperex
Currently, I am thinking of adding more services like hotlines, or more technical services, like an AI physical screening.
